# Studio Project Starter Code (Semester 2, 2021)
Starter code for the Studio Project. This is a simple layout connected to a GitHub Classroom that serves as the basis for implementing the studio project. 

This example program provides:

* A Java class for the Index page (index.html).
* 6x Java classes for 6 pages. Additional pages can be added by adding additional classes.
* JDBCConnection Java class, that uses the Movies Database which is the consistent database example that is used in the project workshop code.
    * You will need to replace the Movies database with the database for the data set for your social challenge.
    * You will need to update the ```DATABASE``` string in ```JDBCConnection.java``` for the new database name.
    * You should replace the example method in ```JDBCConnection.java``` with the required SQL Queries to support your web page.
* ```App.java``` class to configure and setup the Javalin web server. 
    * You will need to uncomment the appropriate lines in ```configureRoutes()``` for any webpages that you need to power through a web form.
* Examples CSS (```common.css```) file in the resources directory
* Example image (```logo.png```) file in the resources directory with where to locate any images you want on your website
* Optional helper program (``ProcessCSV.java``) that shows an example of how to load the SQLite database by using Java to read the CSV files and JDBC insert statements to update the SQLite database

Classes backing Web pages:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ Index.java                    - Homepages/index page. Provides a directory to all other pages
â”œâ”€â”€ Page1.java                    - Sets of 6 other Java class files backing 6 other pages.
â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â””â”€â”€ Page6.java                        
```

â”‚     Â Â   â””â”€â”€ ProcessCSV.java               - Helper Java program to load SQLite database from the provided CSVs
```

Folders:
```bash
â”œâ”€â”€ /src/main                    - Location of all files as required by build configuration

â”‚Â Â        â”‚ Â Â  â””â”€â”€ helper        - Location of the helper file for loading SQLite with JDBC
â”‚Â Â        â””â”€â”€ resources          - Web resources (html templates / style sheets)
â”‚Â Â              â”œâ”€â”€ css          - CSS Style-sheets. Base example style sheet (common.css) provided
â”‚Â Â              â””â”€â”€ images       - Image files. Base example image (RMIT Logo) provided
â”‚Â 
â”œâ”€â”€ /target                      - build directory (DO NOT MODIFY)
â”œâ”€â”€ /database                    - The folder to store sqlite database files (*.db files), SQL script (*.sql), and other files related to the database
â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml                      - Configure Build (DO NOT MODIFY)
â””â”€â”€ README.md                    - This file ;)
```

   * sqlite-jdbc

# Building & Running the code
There are two places code can be run from
1. The **main** web server program
2. the **optional** helper program to use JDBC to load your SQLite database from the CSVs using Java

## Running the Main web server
You can run the main webserver program similar to the project workshop activities
1. Open this project within VSCode
2. Allow VSCode to read the pom.xml file
 - Allow the popups to run and "say yes" to VSCode configuring the build
 - Allow VSCode to download the required Java libraries
3. To Build & Run
 - Open the ``src/main/java/app/App.java`` source file, and select "Run" from the pop-up above the main function
4. Go to: http://localhost:7000

## Running the Helper Program
The helper program in ``src/main/java/helper/ProcessCSV.java`` can be run separetly from the main webserver. This gives a demonstration of how you can use Java to read the provided CSV files and store the information in an SQLite database. This example transforms the data in the ``database/lga_indigenous_status_by_age_by_sex_census_2016.csv`` file to match the format of the ``PopulationStatistics`` entity as given in the example ER Model for Milestone 1 for the Cloing-the-Gap social challenge. That is, the code converts the columns of the CSV into rows that can be loaded into the SQLite database using ``INSERT`` statements.

You can run the optional helper program by
1. Open this ``src/main/java/helper/ProcessCSV.java`` source file
1. Select "Debug" from the pop-up above the main function (or "Debug Java" from the top-right dropdown)
1. Allow the program to run

You can modify this file as you wish, for other tables and CSVs. When modifying you may need to pay attention to:
* ``DATABASE`` field to change the database location
* ``CSV_FILE`` to change which CSV file is bring read
* ``categoty``, ``status``, and ``sex`` arrays which should match the setup of the CSV file being read
* ``INSERT`` statement construction to:
    * Change the table being used
    * Column data being stored

## Testing on GitHub Codespaces
In Semester 2 2021, you will have access to GitHub Codespaces through the RMIT GitHub Organisation. It is highly recommended to test that your code is fully functional in Codespaces.

GitHub Codespaces will be used as the common location to test and verify your studio project. Specifically, GitHub Codespaces will be used to verify your project in the event the code does not correctly function on the local assessor's computer.

# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V16) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
